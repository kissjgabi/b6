            B6.hu’s various features require users to provide us with their contact information (like name and email
            address) and billing information (like account or credit card numbers). We occasionally use our customers'
            contact information to send them important information about our company, such as new services, special
            deals, or special offers from some of our trustworthy partners. This information is also critical in
            situations where it might be necessary to contact our customers. Demographic and profile data which we
            monitor is used primarily to enable us to maintain our superior services. By better understanding our
            customers' patterns and tastes, we're able to constantly improve our site. We use this data to tailor the
            visitor's experience at our site, presenting them content that is relevant and interesting, and displaying
            it according to their preferences. This information can be shared with our trustworthy partners and
            advertisers on an aggregate basis, but these statistics never include any personally identifying
            information. Finally, billing information is used simply to make sure the correct people are charged for the
            correct orders. Your billing information, including your credit card number, is always kept strictly private
            and confidential, and is never shared with outside parties. User information may also be disclosed if we
            have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law,
            regulation, legal process or governmental request; to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of use;
            and to protect we, our customers, or any other person from harm.

            We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your
            information is protected both online and offline. Whenever we collect sensitive information (such as credit
            card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by
            looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser or looking for “https” at the beginning of
            the address of the webpage. While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we
            also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job
            (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The
            computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure
            environment.

            We retain Personal Information where we have an ongoing legitimate business or legal need to do so. Our
            retention periods will vary depending on the type of data involved, but, generally, we'll refer to the
            following criteria to determine retention period: Whether we have a legal or contractual need to retain the
            data; Whether the data is necessary to provide our Services; Whether you have the ability to access and
            delete the data within your accounts; and Whether you would reasonably expect that we would retain the data
            until you remove it or until your account is closed or terminated.
